In level02, we have a file level02.pcap which is available in our home folder
This type of file is usually used to store network traffic data and can be analyzed through scapy
For this, we use the scp command to transfer it on our local host:
scp -P 4242 level02@192.168.56.102:/home/user/level02/level02.pcap Documents/level02.pcap
Then we run the read_pcap script and pipe its output into cat -e, where we can see the following output:
Password: ft_wandr^?^?^?NDRel^?L0L
the '^?' correspond to non printable character DEL
As a result, we have the following password: ft_waNDReL0L
