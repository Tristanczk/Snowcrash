in level02, we have a file level02.pcap which is available in our home folder
this type of file is usually used to store network traffic data and can be analyzed through wireshark
we will use wireshark to analyse it on our kali vm, which supposes to transfer the file to the machine.
For this, we use the scp command to transfer it on our local host:
scp -P 4242 level02@192.168.56.102:/home/user/level02/level02.pcap Documents/level02.pcap
And then we transfer it on our kali machine : scp Documents/level02.pcap kali@192.168.56.103:/home/kali
On kali, we open wireshark with the wireshark command, then file > open > level02.pcap
Then we use the follow TCP stream of wireshark and we see this line:
Password: ft_wandr...NDRel.L0L in ASCII, the '.' correspond to non printable character, and if we look at the hexadecimal code, we see that all 4 are 7f which corresponds to (DEL) in the ASCII table
As a result, we have the following password ft_waNDReL0L
