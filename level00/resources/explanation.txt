We see when looking at files in the VM that most folders / files are owned by root but that some folder / files are owned by flagXX
We look for all files owned by flag00 with "find / -user flag00". There are multiple files for which we have permission denied.
In order to filter, we redirect error messages (fd 2) to /dev/null in order to discard them "find / -user flag00 2>/dev/null"
We have 2 files: /usr/sbin/john and /rofs/usr/sbin/john
filename john might refer to the hash cracking tool John the Ripper
Both files have the same content : cdiiddwpgswtgt
We decipher it usung dcode (caesar cypher with 11 characters gap) : notoohardhere
We use it as password for the su flag 00 command
And we get the flag : x24ti5gi3x0ol2eh4esiuxias
