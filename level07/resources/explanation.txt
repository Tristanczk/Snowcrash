In level 7, we also have an executable that is owned by the flag07 user
When we launch the program, it only prints level07 to the console
Looking at the executable through gdb, we can see it calls getenv to get the value of the following LOGNAME
It thens insert that value inside a command string to execute /bin/echo %s
We can test this hypothesis by changing the content of the logname variable and sure enough when we do, it prints the new content
Therefore, we just have to exploit it in order to execute the getflag command from the program
We can execute a command in echo in bash by doing something like echo "some text $(command)"
Therefore we can just export LOGNAME as $(getflag), using single quotes so that the command is not interpreted > export LOGNAME='$(getflag)'
We then execute our program and we get our flag

Note: it also works using backticks: export LOGNAME='`getflag`'
