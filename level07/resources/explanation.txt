In level 7, we also have an executable that is owned by the flag07 user
When we launch the program, it only prints level07 to the console
Now, when we have a look at the program using strings -d, we see the 2 following lines :
LOGNAME
/bin/echo %s
and a bit above, we also see a call to the getenv function.
If we look at the environment, we see that there is an environment variable logname with the value of level07
The program must most likely echo the content of the logname variable
We can test this hypothesis by changing the content of the logname variable and sure enough when we do, it prints the new content
Therefore, we just have to exploit it in order to execute the getflag command from the program
We can execute a command in echo in bash by doing something like echo "some text $(command)"
Therefore we can just export LOGNAME as $(getflag), using single quotes so that the command is not interpreted > export LOGNAME='$(getflag)'
We then execute our program and we get our flag

Note: it also works using backticks: export LOGNAME='`getflag`'
