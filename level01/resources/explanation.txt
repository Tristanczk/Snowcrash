We can see that the /etc/passwd file is readable for all users
And in this file, while the password hash of all accounts is hidden (replaced by an x, it is available for the account flag01)
The hash passwd is : 42hDRfypTqqnw
As hinted by the name of the previous file, we can use John the Ripper in order to decipher the hash
In order to use john on 42 computers, I set up a docker container with John installed
Then we can copy the /ect/passwd file in the same directory as the Dockerfile
Building and running the Dockerfile gives us the password in the logs: abcdefg
Using getflag, we recover the flag: f2av5il02puano7naaf6adaaf
