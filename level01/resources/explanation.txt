We can see that the /etc/passwd file is readable for all users
And in this file, while the password hash of all accounts is hidden (replaced by an x, it is available for the account flag01)
The hash passwd is : 42hDRfypTqqnw
As hinted by the name of the previous file, we can use John the Ripper in order to decipher the hash
In order to use john on 42 computers, I set up another VM running on Kali Linux (john pre-installed and come with wordlist to use with john)
https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines
Then we can copy the hash in a file hash.txt, specifying an username before "flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw"
Using the command john hash.txt --show, we manage to crack the hash, giving us the following password: abcdefg
Using getflag, we recover the flag: f2av5il02puano7naaf6adaaf
